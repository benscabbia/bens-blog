I'm away on holiday, and decided to pickup a copy of the highly rated [Don't make me think: A common sense approach to web and mobile usablity](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=steve+krug&qid=1564482865&s=gateway&sr=8-2) by Steve Krug. UX is something that I have negleted over the last few years, so I've decided to dive deep into it!

## Chapter 1 - Don't make me think!

- **Don't make the user think**
  - Don't let user waste milliseconds trying to figure something out that's not obvious
  - Users don't like to puzzle over how to do things
  - Users when doing an activity, there is lots of mental chatter and questions that arise e.g.
    - Users should never be asking themselves
      - where am I
      - where should I begin
      - where did they put X
      - what are the most important things on this page
      - why did they call it that
      - is that an ad or part of the site
  - **Your job is to reduce the chatter and questions that come up, as these will lead to errors**
- **If you can't make something self-evident, make it self-explanatory**
  - Using a site that doesn't make you think about unimportant things feels effortless
  - Puzzling over things that are not important saps energy and enthusiasm and time

## Chapter 2 - How we really use the web

- **Users don't read, they scan most of the time**
  - Don't expect them to read your carefully crafted text
- **Users satisfice** (users pick the first reasonable option, not the best option)
  - Why do web users not look for the best choice?
    - Time: optimising is hard, satisficing is more efficient
    - Low consequences: if you get it wrong, you can click back
    - No value guarantee: in poorly designed sites, spending more time does not mean we will make a better choice
    - Fun: there is an eleement of chance, which might be quick and pleasantly surprising
- **Most don't know how things work, they muddle through things** - you use something every day, but do you really know how it works, or just muddle through it and make plausible explanations
  - we do this as its not important
  - we stick to something that it works, but unlikely to look for a better way
- **we don't want users to muddle through things, we want them to feel in control**
  - its more efficient
  - more power to user
  - they'll feel smarter, so more likely to come back

## Chapter 3 - Billboard Design 101

- **Innovate when you know you have a better idea, but take advantage of conventions when you don't**
  - **Don't** try and **reinvent the wheel** unless
    - Its so clear and self-explanatory that there is no learning curve
    - Adds so much value that its worth a small learning curve
- You should still try and **be creative and innovative** and add as much aesthetic appeal as you can, just make sure its usable
- **Clarity thumps consistency** - if you can make something significantly clearer at the expense of a bit of consistency, do it
- **Optimise for scanning**, use hierarchies effectively, sizes, fonts, sections to sort and group content
  - Use **plenty of headings** - make sure size/thickness is different for sub headings and have more space above a heading than below to seperate content
  - **Keep paragraphs short** - even single sentence paragraphs are fine!
  - **Use bulleted lists** - almost anything that can be bulleted, should be. Add a little bit of space between each point to make it clearer
  - **Highlight key terms** - scanning consists of looking for key words/phrases. Bold most important, but not too many or less effective
- **Make it obvious what is clickable**
- **Keep the noise down**
  - Shouting - **not everything can be important**, you have to be discliplined.
  - Disorganization - if the page looks like a ransacked room, then designer doesn't understand **importance of structure**
  - Clutter - **too much stuff**. Low signal to noise ratio - lots of noise, little information.
    - assume everything is visual noise, and remove anything that's not making a real contribution

## Chapter 4 - Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral

- Rule of thumb on number of clicks is 3 mindless == 1 thought click
- **Choices can be difficult**, when they are **provide information that is**:
  - **Brief** - minimun viable information
  - **Timely** - well placed - exactly when needed
  - **Unavoidable** - formatted in a way ensuing its noticed
    - E.g. crossing that has 'look right for traffic' markings

## Chapter 5 - Omit ~~needless~~ words

- **1/2 words on most webpages are redundant** and therefore can be removed without losing meaning
- Once removed half - remove the rest!
  - **The point here is that you should be ruthless** as it
    - **Reduces noise levels**
    - **Makes the useful content more prominent**
    - **Shorter pages, more content per screen**
- **Avoid happy talk**
  - When you read the start of the article and it provides no information except for telling you how great they are, rather than explaining what makes them great
  - Its small talk, most web users just want to get to the point
  - Its fine on home page, but don't let it leak everywhere
- **Avoid instructions** - no one reads them. You should make it self explanatory
  - A survey with instructions - no one will read it if its long, make it short

## Chapter 6
