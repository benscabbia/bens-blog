I'm away on holiday, and decided to pickup a copy of the highly rated [Don't make me think: A common sense approach to web and mobile usablity](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=steve+krug&qid=1564482865&s=gateway&sr=8-2) by Steve Krug. UX is something that I have negleted over the last few years, so I've decided to dive deep into it!

## Chapter 1 - Don't make me think!

- **Don't make the user think**
  - Don't let user waste milliseconds trying to figure something out that's not obvious
  - Users don't like to puzzle over how to do things
  - Users when doing an activity, there is lots of mental chatter and questions that arise e.g.
    - Users should never be asking themselves
      - where am I
      - where should I begin
      - where did they put X
      - what are the most important things on this page
      - why did they call it that
      - is that an ad or part of the site
  - **Your job is to reduce the chatter and questions that come up, as these will lead to errors**
- **If you can't make something self-evident, make it self-explanatory**
  - Using a site that doesn't make you think about unimportant things feels effortless
  - Puzzling over things that are not important saps energy and enthusiasm and time

## Chapter 2

- **Users don't read, they scan most of the time**
  - Don't expect them to read your carefully crafted text
- **Users satisfice** (users pick the first reasonable option, not the best option)
  - Why do web users not look for the best choice?
    - Time: optimising is hard, satisficing is more efficient
    - Low consequences: if you get it wrong, you can click back
    - No value guarantee: in poorly designed sites, spending more time does not mean we will make a better choice
    - Fun: there is an eleement of chance, which might be quick and pleasantly surprising
- **Most don't know how things work, they muddle through things** - you use something every day, but do you really know how it works, or just muddle through it and make plausible explanations
  - we do this as its not important
  - we stick to something that it works, but unlikely to look for a better way
- **we don't want users to muddle through things, we want them to feel in control**
  - its more efficient
  - more power to user
  - they'll feel smarter, so more likely to come back
